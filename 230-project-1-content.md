# Proposal
### Genre: Strategy

### Platform:"universal"

### Story:
As the Commander of a armor division, caught in a stalemate war, you've been tasked with pushing in the flank to break down the enemy line.

### Esthetics:
1. Graphics: semi-realistic
2. Sound: looped combat music and sound effects

### Gameplay:
1. Turn based
2. Set multiple orders than engage all orders at once
3. Ability management
4. Unit experience and upgrades
5. Equipment Damage along with hp (ex: damaged tred when at 5/10 health)
6. Bonus Objectives (Complete in x turns / don't get hit)
7. Able to target specific parts of the enemy tank (Ex: The engine or gunner) which increases chance of hurting that part, but decreases chances for damaging other aspects. (If you're aiming at the gunner, you're not going to hit the engine).

### Control:
Keyboard and/or mouse  OR Touch

### Tutorial:
Instruction guided tutorial levels plus a controls page

### Tactics:
1. Flanking and shooting the back or sides of enemy tanks
2. Avoid being targeted by multiple enemies at the same time
3. Target gunner if being targeted, or target engine to keep hostile from moving

### Inspiration:
Inspired by Warthunder(Tanks) and XCOM
